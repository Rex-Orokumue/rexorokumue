        I’m Rex Orokumue, an AI-first product builder focused on web and mobile. 
        I specialize in creating tools that solve real problems, from job-seeker tools 
        to creator monetization platforms.

      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
        My philosophy: build in public, ship fast, and iterate constantly. 
        I believe in transparency, execution, and scaling smartly.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
        This website itself is a testament to that philosophy — documenting every step 
        of the journey while building something of value.
