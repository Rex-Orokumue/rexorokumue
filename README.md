# Rex Orokumue — AI-First Product Builder Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website built with modern Next.js.

I am documenting this project publicly as I build it to demonstrate:
- Technical growth
- Consistency
- Execution
- Real-world development workflow

---

## 🚀 Project Goal

To build a clean, fast, and scalable portfolio website that:
- Showcases my AI-first product thinking
- Documents my build process
- Serves as a foundation for future products

---

## 🏗 Tech Stack (Day 1 Setup)

- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- ESLint

---

## 🧠 Why I Chose This Setup

Even as a beginner, I wanted to start with a modern and scalable foundation.

### TypeScript
For type safety and long-term maintainability.

### Tailwind CSS
For fast, responsive, utility-first styling.

### ESLint
To enforce clean coding standards.

### App Router
Because it is the future of Next.js routing and avoids migration later.
